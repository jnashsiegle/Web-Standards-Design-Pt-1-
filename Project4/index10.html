		<h2 id = "History">History</h2>
		
<p>In England the earliest known personification of Christmas does not describe him as old, nor refer to him as 'father'. A carol attributed to Richard Smart, Rector of Plymtree from <time datetime = "1435">1435</time> to <time datetime = "1477">1477</time>, takes the form of a sung dialogue between a choir and a figure representing Christmas, variously addressed as "Nowell", "Sir Christemas" and "my lord Christemas". He does not distribute presents to children but is associated with adult celebrations. Giving news of Christ's birth, Christmas encourages everyone to eat and drink: <q>Buvez bien par toute la campagnie,/Make good cheer and be right merry.</q> However, the specific depiction of Christmas as a merry old man emerged in the early 17th century. The rise of puritanism had led to increasing condemnation of the traditions handed down from pre-Reformation times, especially communal feasting and drinking. As debate intensified, those writing in support of the traditional celebrations often personified Christmas as a venerable, kindly old gentleman, given to good cheer but not excess. They referred to this personification as "Christmas", "Old Christmas" or "Father Christmas".</p>

<p>Ben Jonson in <i>Christmas his Masque</i>, dating from <time datetime = "1616-12">December 1616</time>, notes the rising tendency to disparage the traditional forms of celebration. His character 'Christmas' therefore appears in outdated fashions, <q>attir'd in round Hose, long Stockings, a close Doublet, a high crownd Hat with a Broach, a long thin beard, a Truncheon, little Ruffes, white shoes, his Scarffes, and Garters tyed crosse</q>, and announces <q>Why Gentlemen, doe you know what you doe? ha! would you ha'kept me out? Christmas, old Christmas?</q> Later, in a masque by Thomas Nabbes, <i>The Springs Glorie</i> produced in <time datetime="1638">1638,</time>, "Christmas" appears as <q>an old reverend gentleman in furred gown and cap.</q></p>



<p>During the mid-17th century, the debate about the celebration of Christmas became politically charged, with Royalists adopting a pro-Christmas stance and radical puritans striving to ban the festival entirely. Early in <time datetime = "1646">1646 </time>an anonymous satirical author wrote <i>The Arraignment, Conviction and Imprisoning of Christmas</i>, in which a Royalist lady is frantically searching for Father Christmas: this was followed months later by the Royalist poet John Taylor's <i>The Complaint of Christmas</i>, in which Father Christmas mournfully visits puritan towns but sees <q>...no sign or token of any Holy Day</q>. A book dating from the time of the Commonwealth, <i>The Vindication of CHRISTMAS or, His Twelve Yeares' Observations upon the Times</i> (London, <time datetime="1652">1652 </time>), involved "Old Christmas" advocating a merry, alcoholic Christmas and casting aspersions on the charitable motives of the ruling Puritans. In a similar vein, a humorous pamphlet of <time datetime="1686">1686</time> by Josiah King presents Father Christmas as the personification of festive traditions pre-dating the puritan commonwealth. He is described as an elderly gentleman of cheerful appearance, <q>who when he came look't so smug and pleasant, his cherry cheeks appeared through his thin milk white locks, like (b)lushing Roses vail'd with snow white Tiffany</q>. His character is associated with feasting, hospitality and generosity to the poor rather than the giving of gifts.</p>

<p>This tradition continued into the following centuries, with "Old Father Christmas" being evoked in <time datetime="1734">1734</time> in the pamphlet <i>Round About Our Coal Fire</i>, as <q>Shewing what Hospitality was in former Times, and how little of it there remains at present</q>, a rebuke to "stingy" gentry. A writer in <i>Time's Telescope</i><time datetime="1822"> (1822) </time> states that in Yorkshire at eight o'clock on Christmas Eve the bells greet "Old Father Christmas" with a merry peal, the children parade the streets with drums, trumpets, bells, (or in their absence, with the poker and shovel, taken from their humble cottage fire), the yule candle is lighted, and; <q>High on the cheerful fire. Is blazing seen th' enormous Christmas brand.</q> A letter to <i>The Times</i> in <time datetime="1825">1825,</time> warning against poultry-dealers dishonestly selling off sub-standard geese at Christmas time, is jokingly signed "Father Christmas".</p>

<p>In these early references, Father Christmas, although invariably an old and cheerful man, is mainly associated with adult feasting and drinking rather than the giving of presents. Since the mid-Victorian era however, Father Christmas has gradually merged with the pre-modern gift-giver St Nicholas (Dutch Sinterklaas, hence Santa Claus) and associated folklore. Nowadays in Britain the figure is often called Santa Claus but also often referred to as Father Christmas: the two names are synonyms. In Europe, the figure is usually translated as Father Christmas <i>(Père Noël, Papá Noel, Padre Noel,</i> etc.) rather than "Santa Claus" and is often said to reside in the mountains of Korvatunturi in Lapland Province, Finland.</p>

<p>Father Christmas is often seen as synonymous with Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Father Christmas often appears as a large man, often around seventy years old. He is dressed in a red suit trimmed with white fur, often girdled with a wide black belt, a matching hat, often long and floppy in nature, and dark boots. Often he carries a large brown sack filled with toys on his back (rarely, images of him have a beard but with no moustache). Urban myth has it that the red suit only appeared after the Coca Cola company started an advertising campaign depicting a red suited Father Christmas in the <time datetime = "1930">1930s.</time> However, the red suit was used long before, including by American illustrator Thomas Nast.</p>

<p>Father Christmas comes down the chimney to put presents under the Christmas tree or in children's rooms, in their stockings. Some families leave a glass of sherry or mulled wine, mince pies, biscuits, or chocolate and a carrot for his reindeer near the stocking(s) as a present for him. In modern homes without chimneys he uses alternative means to enter the home, such as a magical key that unlocks all doors. In some homes children write Christmas lists (of wished-for presents) and send them up the chimney or post them. He is often said to live at the North Pole.</p>
